= Overall =

Right now my goal is to get the game in a basic playable form for an 0.1 release, because I think that will do a lot to raise interest in the project.  But that is still a ways off.

After that, focus will shift to:
* Making game simulations more realistic
* Improving performance
* Porting to Windows
* Polishing the UI

= Major Remaining Tasks For 0.1 =

* Finish New/Open/Save/Save As code
* Support multiple seasons
* Contracts
* Trades
* Free agents
* Add more players and teams to the database
* Probably more... (you can see it is a long ways off)
