# This project has moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm) #

The overall goal of this project is to create a sports simulation game like [Baseball Mogul](http://www.sportsmogul.com/), but make it free, cross platform, and about basketball. However, at this stage, **it's not a very fun or usable game yet**. You probably don't want to download it unless you think you might want to contribute some code to help work towards making it a fun game.

An auxiliary goal is for me to learn some new things (Python, GTK, Glade, SQLite).  So, the code might not be the greatest and development might be a little slow because I am a beginner in all of those technologies.  But I am trying :)

Send an email to **dumbmatter at gmail** if you think this project sounds interesting.

**2010-08-21**: After a 2+ year hiatus, I committed some very minor improvements to SVN. However, I have no idea if this is an anomaly or a sign of things to come. Time will tell..

**2008-08-08**: Version 0.1 is released.  Try it out.  If you think it looks interesting and you can code, email me.  There are a lot of things that can be improved.

**2008-08-03**: All the goals for 0.1 are now complete except for the trade AI and a little bit of polish.  Expect a release later this month.

**2008-07-27**: Right now I am working towards an 0.1 release that will include basic functionality, but the AI will be weak, the UI won't be polished, etc.  But it will be a good framework to test and build on.  The only major components left are finances (ticket and TV revenue, etc.), trades (UI is there but AI is not), and playoffs.  But if you checkout the latest source, it should run on most Linux distros and do everything except the three things I just mentioned, if you want to play around with it.  Regular season, roster management, free agents, draft, stats... all that stuff is in some rudimentary working form.
