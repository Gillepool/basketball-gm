MINOR:
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
too many bigs labeled as F, not enough PF and C and FC

MAJOR:
draft
    click "start draft"
    button switches to "draft player" but inactive
    becomes active only when it is the user's turn
    double click on either treeview to open player dialog
salaries
free agents
    team_id = -1
trades
playoffs
game_sim improvements
    overtime
    take all ratings into account

SOME TIME:
s/in range/in xrange/
make a ~/.basketball-gm folder for data files
google: python warnings
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
combine ratings and stats views
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
