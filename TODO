        if a team is over the salary cap, their incoming salary must be <= 125% their outgoing salary
    trade AI
the simulation should be stopped automatically before saving, save_nosave_cancel call, (trades?)
    self.games_in_progress to indicate if games are being played or not

    Put this code wherever the simulation should be automatically stopped:
    if self.games_in_progress:
        self.stop_games = True
        while self.games_in_progress:
            sleep (like in draft)
playoffs
    use self.is_playoffs in game_sim.py to set a flag for the stats to separate regular season from playoffs
F10 is taken, use something else for week
update contents of windows (roster, player info, free agents)
show age in roster window
are all imports needed?  sys, pango?

FUTURE
======

GAMESIM
-------
overtime
take all ratings into account
blocks, assists (maybe other things) should not be so evenly distributed
home and away games

UI
--
view any team in the roster window
    drop down box at the top with team names
    all actions disabled unless team_id == common.PLAYER_TEAM_ID
    open this window when a team is double-clicked on in the standings
need a good way of updating windows (player, roster, etc.) on changes
    do this after getting a good general treeview system for updates
    player/roster window should update after game played, player signed/released/drafted
customize which columns are displayed in treeviews - kiwi
treeview formatting
    str, int, float, currency, date, age - do formatting based on column type
progress bars
combine ratings and stats tabs - use one model and just show different columns
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
        or: set accelerators in python code, not glade.  then i can reuse F12
on new/open game:
    close all open dialogs/windows
    refresh all tabs of the main window

NBA
---
real salary cap rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Salary_Cap
    released players should count against cap
real contract rules (max/min, etc.)
allow contracts that aren't the same $ every year
team and player options
releasing players - see the salary cap wiki page for complicated rule
luxury tax: (team_salary - 65mil) penalty if team salary is > 65mil

BACKEND
-------
archive stats as averages - this will make the end of season awards feasible, and make the stats view faster/easier
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
uncertainty in rating - for each player, calculate a randn(0, 3) with max/min of +/- 5
    calculate a new one each year and add it to 1/2 of the previous one
teams should be smart in resigning players (now it's just random)
use constants for phase #'s, other things.  maybe create a dict CONST in common.py?

FEATURES
--------
injuries
opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
change prices of tickets, concessions, etc
hire coaches to influence development
different sized cities with differently passionate fanbases - affects attendance and home court advantage
playoffs
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
advanced stats (+/-, PER, etc)
punishment for going in debt: if cash is less than $10M, can't sign any new contracts
