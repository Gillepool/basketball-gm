REQUIREMENTS FOR 0.1 RELEASE:
salaries
free agents
    team_id = -1
retirement - some function of age and rating and random.gauss
releasing players
when games are being simulated, the play menu should have "Stop" in it, and it should work
    also, the simulation should be stopped before saving
trades
pretty dialog at the end of the season with awards, etc.
    mvp: PER*win%
    

FUTURE:
advanced stats (+/-, PER, etc)
playoffs
game_sim improvements
    overtime
    take all ratings into account
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
        or: set accelerators in python code, not glade.  then i can reuse F12
too many bigs labeled as F, not enough PF and C and FC
need a good way of updating windows (player, roster, etc.) on changes
    do this after getting a good general treeview system for updates
customize which columns are displayed in treeviews
make a ~/.basketball-gm folder for data files
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
combine ratings and stats tabs - use one model and just show different columns
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
psyco?
cython - rewrite parts as modules to make it faster?
