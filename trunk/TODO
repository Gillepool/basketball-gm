"Season Ticket Basketball"

REQUIREMENTS FOR 0.1 RELEASE:
finance
    rookie contracts
    luxury tax: (team_salary - 65mil) penalty if team salary is > 65mil
    for each game:
        attendance: f(2*hometeamwinp + awayteamwinp)
        cost: team_salary/num_games_in_season
    finances tab - team | avg attendance | team payroll | revenue (YTD) | profit (YTD) | cash
            revenue = attendance * ticket_price + tv_money / num_games + luxary_tax_amount(+ or -)
            profit = revenue - SUM(cost)
free agents
    team_id = -1
    salary cap: 50mil
        if a team is over, they can only sign their own players and min contracts
when games are being simulated, the play menu should have "Stop" in it, and it should work
    also, the simulation should be stopped automatically before saving, trading, and negotiating contracts
trades
    if a team is over the salary cap, their incoming salary must be <= 125% their outgoing salary
    basic trade AI
roster window
    buttons - releasing players, etc
    display age and contract info
some players (rookies mainly) have ratings higher than potentials - fix this (potentail should be set to overall)
add placeholders for all the unfinished items - i think this is done

FUTURE:
opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
change prices of tickets, concessions, etc
hire coaches to influence development
injuries
different sized cities with differently passionate fanbases - affects attendance
real contract and salary cap rules
view any team in the roster window
    drop down box at the top with team names
    all actions disabled unless team_id == common.PLAYER_TEAM_ID
    open this window when a team is double-clicked on in the standings
archive stats as averages - this will make the end of season awards feasible, and make the stats view faster
    it will also allow computation of advanced stats (+/-, PER, etc)
playoffs
game_sim improvements
    overtime
    take all ratings into account
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
        or: set accelerators in python code, not glade.  then i can reuse F12
too many bigs labeled as F, not enough PF and C and FC
need a good way of updating windows (player, roster, etc.) on changes
    do this after getting a good general treeview system for updates
customize which columns are displayed in treeviews - kiwi
treeview formatting
    str, int, float, currency, date, age - do formatting based on column type
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
combine ratings and stats tabs - use one model and just show different columns
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
psyco?
cython - rewrite parts as modules to make it faster?
