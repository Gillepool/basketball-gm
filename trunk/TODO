MINOR:
make a ~/.basketball-gm folder for data files

SOME TIME:
google: python warnings
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
combine ratings and stats views
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
psyco?
