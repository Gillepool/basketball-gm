MINOR:
play menu
    on open game, update the play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
player develop should alter potential too

MAJOR:
draft - see draft_dialog.py comments
salaries
free agents
    team_id = -1
trades
playoffs
game_sim improvements
    overtime
    take all ratings into account

SOME TIME:
make a ~/.basketball-gm folder for data files
google: python warnings
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter - see pygtk tutorial
combine ratings and stats views
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup

cython - rewrite parts as modules to make it faster?
